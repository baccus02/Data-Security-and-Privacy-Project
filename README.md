# SQL Database Security Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the SQL source code for a database system designed to manage healthcare records with an emphasis on security. It includes scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and implementing security features.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login using hashed passwords.
- **Access Control**: Differentiated user access, with specific roles able to view or modify certain data.
- **Data Integrity**: Hash checks to ensure data hasn't been tampered with.
- **Data Confidentiality**: Encryption of sensitive data to protect patient privacy.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the SQL scripts into your MySQL Workbench or preferred SQL management tool.
3. Execute the scripts in the order provided to set up the database schema and security features.

## Contributions
This project is the result of an individual effort by Deanna Baccus. All planning, development, testing, and documentation were managed solely by me.

## Limitations
The project serves as a prototype and is not intended for real-world application without further security enhancements, including more advanced encryption and key management strategies.
